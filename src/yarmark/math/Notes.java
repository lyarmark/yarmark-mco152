	 * a set is an unordered groups of objects that can have no duplicates
	 * 
	 * a hash set can remove/add/lookup elements without looking through the
	 * whole list you don't need to go through everything because you know where
	 * it's located.
	 * 
	 * to do unique string with hashcode, if the string is not included in the
	 * set, print it out and add it to the set then, next time you find it, it
	 * will be in the set so it wont print
	 * 
	 * a hash set need its type defined like an arraylist
	 * 
	 * hashMap- has an Integer counter and a string value map.get will return
	 * null if the value has not been seen before so you can call
	 * map.put(string, 1) if there already has been this string call
	 * map.put(string, count+1) add 1 to however many times this string has been
	 * seen
	 * 
	 * you don't have to interate through a map to see if the value is there you
	 * can use .contains() or check if .get(string) is null
	 * 
	 * to iterate through the whole map,
	 * 
	 * HOMEWORK redo scrabble with hashSet redo morseCode with map in the same
	 * map, put the letter with the morse and the morse with the letter 52 times
	 * 
	 * find the largest groups of words that are anagrams with each other main
	 * mostAnagrams, no test
