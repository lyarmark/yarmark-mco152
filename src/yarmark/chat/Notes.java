/*
 * html forms have to define methods
 * GET- get data
 * POST- send data
 * 
 * an http request will be made with the GET
 * 
 * comes along with a status code.
 * 200- eveything ok
 * response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_OK);
 * 
 * 
 * 404- page not found
 * 304- not modified since you last send information to this request
 * when you make a request, your computer sends identifying info:
 * which browser/OS- to format properly
 * which languages you use- to give results in that lang
 * 
 * cache- browser has a cache, OS has a cache
 * so next time you request it, it can compare it to the cache
 * and see if it was changed
 * 
 * internet is all about speed
 * if you can cut down on the amnt of time transferring data
 * saves time and maybe money
 * 
 * that's why hueniquedesign loaded slow 1st time
 * and better next time
 * 
 * google doodles- based on location
 * searching in a diff lang.
 * 
 * google changed its logo:
 * the new pic is compressed smaller
 * new focus on ppl with only mobile device
 * and newly developing tech in some countries
 * 
 * pictures vector vs. raster
 * vector is faster to describe to ppl and computer (new logo)
 * 
 * napster- 
 * before the possibility of buying mustic on line, ppl discovered you can compress music files
 * but there was no way to get them with out downloading, and that's illegal
 * napster connected ppl who wanted and ppl who gave mp3 files
 * all computers requesting a song connected to napster
 * napster searched all the computers connected to it for one with the song
 * that computer auto uploads the song to napster and gives to requester
 * this uses pee-to-peer sharing.
 * no need for middle man main server
 * they got sued a lot, but many other companies sprang from it.
 * 
 * we know how to do server and HttpConnection, so we can talk to e/o
 * goal- have everyone communicate in a peer-to-peer distributed way 
 *
